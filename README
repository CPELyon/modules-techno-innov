mod_gpio_demo is an example code for the development module made by
Techno-Innov.

It has support for the LPC1224 as used on this development module, and
for the peripherals found on the development module (Led, eeprom and
temperature sensor).

By default, both uarts are configured to echo any received character.
The programm will send the identification found in the EEPROM once and
then send the temperature in an endless loop on UART1, while playing with
the status LED.

More usefull stuff is up to you.


********************
BUID and FLASH

Build has been tested using gcc, and only gcc, in the version provided by
the emdebian project, but any ARM gcc toolchain should do.

In order to get the emdebian ARM gcc cross-toolchain you should add this
repository to your apt sources :
   deb http://www.emdebian.org/debian/ unstable main
and then update and install package gcc-4.7-arm-linux-gnueabi
It may be required that you create a symlink in /usr/bin for the arm gcc
   cd /usr/bin && ln -s arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc-4.7 arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc

There's no need for the related libc package here, the libc does not fit
in our micro-controller memory. Instead have a look at the content of the
lib/ directory, and add stuff there.

Once done you should build using the provided makefile by running the
simple "make" command.

To flash the binary (the one with .bin) to the LPC Flash you will need
our lpctool package (not yet packaged for Debian as of 2013-11-06)
available in our git repository : http://git.techno-innov.fr/lpctools
Clone using :
   git clone http://gitclone.techno-innov.fr/lpctools
Then build (make) and use :)
Usual command lines :
   ./lpcprog -d /dev/ttyUSB0 -c id
   ./lpcprog -d /dev/ttyUSB0 -c flash mod_gpio.bin
See lpctools readme and lpcprog or isp help (-h) or manpages for more
information.
