This app provides an SWD bridge for remote bitbang SWD access using openocd.
This allows remote debugging using gdb.

Get openOCD with the SWD bitbang patch from this git repository:
   http://gitweb.cypou.net/?p=openocd-code.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/bitbang
Compile using:
  ./bootstrap
  ./configure --enable-remote-bitbang

Use with (change the /dev/ttyXXX and target/XXX according to your needs):
 openocd -c "interface remote_bitbang; remote_bitbang_host /dev/ttyUSB0; transport select swd; gdb_port 3333; telnet_port 4444" -f target/lpc12xx.cfg


Connection to the remote target :
You must connect P0_23 and P0_24 from this board to swdio and swdclk on target board.
Local         Remote
  P0_23  --->   swdio
  P0_24  --->   swdclk
